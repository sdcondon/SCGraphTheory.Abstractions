This repository contains the source code for the SCGraphTheory.Abstractions NuGet package.

## Package Documentation

For documentation of the package itself, see https://sdcondon.net/SCGraphTheory/abstractions.

## Source Documentation

I have not written up any documentation of the source. The package consists of just three interfaces - doing so would be entirely pointless.
Note, however, that some musings about these interfaces *are* included in the package documentation.

## Issues and Contributions

I'm not expecting anyone to want to get involved given the low download figures on NuGet, but please feel free to do so.
I do keep an eye on the [issues](https://github.com/sdcondon/SCFirstOrderLogic/issues) tab, and will add a CONTRIBUTING.md if anyone drops me a message expressing interest.
